#Class: 
FRK19S, Group 7

#App Description: 
We created an online app for Candy Shop. Candy Shop is an application where a user can see what items the caf√©s in his/her region has to offer and be able to purchase them. 

#App Functionality:
Pick out an item, add it to cart, buy item.

#Brief description of how we divided the task:
We created Figma together- both the mobile and the desktop version
We created trello and the user stories together. All group members participate and work on both versions and we also did the sass and style guide together. Most parts of the app are done together (working every day from 10:00 to 16:30); however, for some parts each group member takes a card that wants to work on. 
We had a scrum meeting every working day for 10-15 minutes that everyone agrees on. We update each other on our progress, help and share our ideas if needed.
We had a great communication and communicate a lot on discord grupprum-7-text, voice and sharing screen e.g. if someone has pushed on github or changed something, and so on. We discussed about every and each part together and we all agree on.
We created different branches for all group members and have a dev branch where all members can push their code. We also have a master branch.
